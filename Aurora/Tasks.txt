To Do :

	Notes:

	General:
		Audio:
			•	Make a background music player for the game
			•	Ambient noises will come from in game (birds, wind / weather), although weather might be truly ambient
			•	Other noises will come from objects in the game
		Loading Files:
			•	Load resources from a res folder now. Need to be able to read from a different folder on the computer. The reason for res right now is to share resources on GitHub
			•	Need to be able to load settings
			•	Need to be able to save and load worlds
			
	Screen:
		GUIs:
			•	Need to work on different components for the GUIs
				•	Need to make text fields, combo boxes, fix progress bars, fix text align
			•	Menus need to be finished (single player load world, multiplayer, settings), however we need to wait for some of these things
			•	There needs to be an easy way to add HUDs to the game. These will always be on the in-game screen
			•	There needs to be a mechanic for GUIs that pop up, like inventory
			•	There needs to be a way to implement interactables, such as a forge

			•	Possibly fix multithreading, but I don't think that's an issue
		Entities:
			•	Implement Collision Detection
		Particles:
			•	Singular particles that represent explosions?
			•	Spawn in different shapes
			•	There's way too much to do here
		Shadows:
			•	Fix shadows not being connected
			•	Make it so light can cancel out shadows
			•	Animated Model Shadows
		Skybox:
			•	Make it transition and have weather
			•	Make a lens flare and sun. Do this with sampling
		Terrain:
			•	Figure another way to make the terrain other than when its null
			•	The code in here is awful
			•	Make the normals generate faster. Do this with an array
		Water:
			•	Figure out how to make rivers
			•	Directional flow ^^^
